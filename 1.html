Hirakana had beed used by women, not man. But now it is used not only women but men. Hirakana is equivalent at lower English alphabet.(actually, it is quite diffrent.   but at first time to learn  Japanese, it is easy to understand)

            Katakana looks like more sharp and square, like  Chinease. Katakana had been used by men, not women. But like Hirakana, Katakana is  also used women and men both. Katakana is generally used expressing strong word or foreign word.
